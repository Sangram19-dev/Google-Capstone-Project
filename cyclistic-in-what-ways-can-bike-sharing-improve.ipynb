Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. \n\n# Case study \n\nThis report will examine the business question: 'what is the most effective marketing strategy to converting  Cyclistic’s casual riders to annul memberships?'\n\nIt is understood that the goal can be broken down into 3 main questions.\n\n 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? \n 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? \n 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n\nThis report will seek to deliver on the following objectives:\n\nHow do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\n# Stakeholders\n\nThis report also seeks to identify the important stakeholders that are involved in the overall analysis. This includes: \n- cyclistic users, \n- director of marketing,\n- Cyclistic marketing team\n- Cyclistic executive team\n\n# Data sources\n\nUser data from the past 12 months, January 2021 - December 2021 has been made available.

Their participation exceeded that of the long term members.\n- To further that the Casual demographic spent on average a lot longer time per ride than their long-term counter-parts. \n- The days of the week also further shows that causal riders prefer to use the service during the weekends as their usage peaked then. The long term members conversly utilised the service more-so throughout the typical work week i.e (Monday- friday)\n- Long term riders tended to stick more so to classic bikes as opposed to the docked or electric bikes.\n\n# Recommendations\n##### This report recommends the following:\n- Introducing plans thats may be more appealing to casuals for the summer months. This marketing should be done during the winter months in preperation. \n- The casual users might be more interested in a memebrship option that allows for per-use balance card. Alternatively, the existing payment structure may be altered in order to make single-use more costly to the casual riders as well as lowering the long-term membership rate.\n- Membership rates specifically for the warmer months as well as for those who only ride on the weekends would assist in targeting the casual riders more specifically\n\n# Things to Consider\n\n## Additional points that were not examined\n The report understands the scope of this analysis is extremely limited and because of that fact, additional data, as well as data points may have been able to contribute to this report offering an even more granular analysis. The following are data points that could have enhanced the report:\n \n - Age and gender: This would add a dynamic to whether or not customers are being targeted across demograpic lines. Is the existing marketing effective? Is there potential for more inclusive targeting?\n - Pricing structure: THe actual pricing plans data was not provided and would give further insight to which plans are the most popular and by (how much) when comparing them. It would also be effective to understanding the spending behaviour of casual user.\n - Household income data: Pinpointing the average income of the long-term memebrs as compared to the casual counter-parts would allow for further analysis of what is the typical economic standing of each type of member, as well as providing the ability to analysis overall price sensitivity between the two different membership types.\n \n \n### Thank you for your time!\n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
